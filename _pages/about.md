Hi, my name is Denis and I work at Panasonic AI Lab in Mountain View office. My research projects belong to general Machine Learning area and, more specifically, they are focused on various aspects of recent Deep Learning methods for Computer Vision applications (see [a short bio](#bio) below). This is my personal page with recent [publications](/publications/), [talks](/talks/), and [CV](/cv/) updates. In my free time, I enjoy riding motorcycles and mountaineering in Sierra Nevada.

## Bio

Denis Gudovskiy is a senior researcher at Panasonic AI lab in Mountain View. He specializes in deep learning-based algorithms for AI applications. His portfolio of research projects includes optimization of deep neural networks for edge AI devices, explainable AI tools, and automatic dataset management for computer vision applications. Before joining Panasonic in 2016, Denis held research and engineering positions in Intel, Olympus and Huawei wireless divisions. Denis received his M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Texas, Austin in 2008.

In one of such projects he proposed and implemented a method of hardware-efficient neural network quantization and compression techniques for autonomous vehicles with stringent power and performance requirements. In the most recent work, Denis has demonstrated how data annotation costs could be significantly reduced with a use of advanced algorithms. His papers and demos are presented and published in top-tier machine learning and computer vision conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV, ICLR and ICASSP.

Denis sees corporate research as an important layer between moonshot academia projects and clearly-defined product development roadmaps in business units. His goal is to find and promote viable academia-grade opportunities at Panasonic within the exponentially growing landscape of AI applications.
