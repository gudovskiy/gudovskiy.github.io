This talk has been presented at [Edge AI Summit 2019](https://www.edgeaisummit.com/) and [ODS Data Fest 2020](https://ods.ai/projects/datafest). It covers topics related to embedded AI technologies for computer vision (autonomous driving) applications being developed in Panasonic. I introduce a variety of Panasonic R&D projects from hardware-efficient network quantization and compression techniques to pedestrian detection for embedded autonomous vision systems.
